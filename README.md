# Spanish Conjugation

Learning to conjugate Spanish verbs is difficult.  This is my attempt at making it easier: writing this program
is helping me understand the way the verbs are conjugated, and the program is designed as a flashcard system
intended to help with the memorization of verb conjugations.

To install it simply clone it and:

    bundle install

To run it simply:

    ruby conjugate.rb
